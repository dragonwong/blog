	Love is just the thing you fear to give.

	I want to sing you a song<br >
	F G | C<br >

	F G | C Am<br >
	我們終於去到了九龍塘<br >
	F G | C<br >
	在城大旁的酒店爆房<br >
	F G | C Am<br >
	你臉上沒有一點點的徬徨<br >
	F G | C<br >
	我們都似是很開放<br >
	C | Em<br >
	I want to sing you a song<br >
	F G | C<br >
	about me and you went to Kowloon Tong<br >
	C | Em<br >
	we have to be very strong<br >
	F G | C<br >
	if we want to do something very wrong<br >
	F G | C Am | F G | C<br >
	(bridge)<br >
	F G | C Am | F G | C<br >
	(bridge)<br >
	F G | C Am<br >
	我們打開房便見到一張床<br >
	F G | C<br >
	然後才開始覺有點慌<br >
	F G | C Am<br >
	我在想應否真的行房<br >
	F G | C<br >
	這樣會否破壞了交往<br >
	F G | C<br >
	我們會否繼續再交往
