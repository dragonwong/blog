<p>
	Love is not just a song.<br >
	Love is not just you and me.<br >
	Love is not the kiss you''re looking for so long.<br >
	Love is not just words and melody.<br >
	Love is not one night in a week.<br >
	Love is not missing someone with tears.<br >
	Love is not the passion you think you got a lot.<br >
	Love is just the years.<br >
	Love is just the thing you fear to give.<br >
